### Intro

I like to listen to white/brown noise while programming, as it cancels out all the environmental sounds and helps me to concetrate. I was using YouTube, but I need something that wasn't going to distract me anytime that I wanted to start or stop the sounds. Hence this app.

I plan to add a GUI in the end, but I am pretty new to Python, so I'm still figuring out how best to approach everything.
